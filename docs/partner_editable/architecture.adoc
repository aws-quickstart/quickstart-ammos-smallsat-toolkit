AWS Cloud.

image::../images/nasa-ammos-smallsat-toolkit-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.
* In the public subnets:
** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in public and private subnets.
** An Application Load Balancer to route traffic from the web to the EC2 instances in the private subnets.
** A managed network address translation (NAT) gateway to provide outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.
* In the private subnets:
** An EC2 instance that serves the AIT and Open MCT applications using Apache HTTP Server. This instance runs in an Auto Scaling group.
** An EC2 instance that serves the AIT Editor application. This instance runs in a Docker container to mitigate the impact of system commands that are executed from the VS Codeâ€“integrated terminal that's exposed in the browser.
* Amazon Cognito to manage identities and authenticate users.
* Amazon CloudWatch to receive log data from the EC2 instances in the private subnets using Amazon CloudWatch Logs agents.
* AWS Lambda to process logs for Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.
* Kinesis Data Firehose to deliver log data from CloudWatch Logs to Amazon S3 and Amazon OpenSearch Service (successor to Amazon Elasticsearch Service).
* Amazon Route 53 to provide a canonical name (CNAME) record, an alias for the Application Load Balancer.
* Two S3 buckets, one for long-term storage of log files and the other for configuration files.
