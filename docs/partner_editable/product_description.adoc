The core of this lightweight software bundle is the https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/AIT-Core[AMMOS Instrument Toolkit (AIT)^]. AIT is a Python-based software suite that handles GDS, electrical ground support equipment (EGSE), commanding, telemetry uplink and downlink, and sequencing. AIT integrates with https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/openmct-mcws[Open Mission Control Technologies (Open MCT)^] software, which provides visualization and dashboarding capabilities. AIT also integrates with https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NASA-AMMOS.ait-editor[AIT Editor^], a Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code or VSC) extension that provides a centralized, browser-based environment for generating and editing spacecraft command-sequence files. 

This software suite includes a set of basic test data so that you can verify your installation. The software meets the needs common to most SmallSat and CubeSat missions with minimal adaptation. It comes with instructions for adapting the deployment for your operation's needs both at launch and as your mission evolves.
