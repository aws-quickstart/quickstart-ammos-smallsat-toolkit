This guide provides instructions for deploying the {partner-product-name} Quick Start on the AWS Cloud. 

This Quick Start deploys NASA's https://ammos.nasa.gov/[Advanced Multi-Mission Operations System (AMMOS)^] suite of capabilities for small satellite, CubeSat, and instrument missions. The AMMOS SmallSat Toolkit offers advanced sequence generation, command uplink and downlink, telemetry processing, and data visualization. Using this Quick Start, your team can rapidly deploy a foundational ground data system (GDS) that is built on mission-proven capabilities and maintained by NASA. The AMMOS suite comprises open-source products that are available in the https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS[NASA-AMMOS GitHub repository^], where contributions are welcomed and encouraged.
