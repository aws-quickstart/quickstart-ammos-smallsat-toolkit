[.small]#* During deployment, you can choose the AIT instance type to fit your workload. The default instance type, `m5.large`, contains enough compute and memory resources for most workloads, as suggested by the AIT development team. The best choice for your mission depends on expected telemetry throughput, level of message processing required, and latency requirements defined by the mission. We recommend 2–4 cores and 4–8 GiB of memory for the AIT instance.#
