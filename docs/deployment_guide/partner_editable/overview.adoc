This guide covers the information you need to deploy the {partner-product-name} Partner Solution in the AWS Cloud.

This Amazon Web Services (AWS) Partner Solution deploys NASA's https://ammos.nasa.gov/[Advanced Multi-Mission Operations System (AMMOS)^] suite of capabilities for small satellite, CubeSat, and instrument missions. The AMMOS SmallSat Toolkit offers advanced sequence generation, command uplink and downlink, telemetry processing, and data visualization. Using this Partner Solution, your team can rapidly deploy a foundational ground data system (GDS) that is built on mission-proven capabilities and maintained by NASA. The AMMOS suite comprises open-source products that are available in the https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS[NASA-AMMOS GitHub repository^], where contributions are welcomed and encouraged. 

The toolkit includes the following:

* https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/AIT-Core[AMMOS Instrument Toolkit (AIT)^], a Python-based software suite that handles GDS, electrical ground support equipment (EGSE), commanding, telemetry uplink and downlink, and sequencing.
* https://github.com/nasa/openmct[Open Mission Control Technologies (Open MCT)^] software, providing visualization and dashboarding capabilities.
* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NASA-AMMOS.ait-editor[AIT Sequence Editor^], a Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension that provides a centralized, browser-based environment for generating and editing spacecraft command sequence files.
* A set of basic test data so you can test the software capabilities upon installation.
* Instructions for adapting the deployment for your operation's needs both at launch and as your mission evolves.

This Partner Solution is designed to meet the core demands of your mission with minimal adaptation.
