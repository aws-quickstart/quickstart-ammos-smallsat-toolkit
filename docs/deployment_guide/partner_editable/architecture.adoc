.Partner Solution architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/nasa-ammos-smallsat-toolkit-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in public and private subnets.*
** An Application Load Balancer to route traffic from the web to the EC2 instances in the private subnets.
** A managed network address translation (NAT) gateway to provide outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
** An EC2 instance that serves the AIT and Open MCT applications using Apache HTTP Server. This instance runs in an Auto Scaling group.
** An EC2 instance that serves the AIT Sequence Editor application. This application runs in a Docker container on the instance to mitigate the impact of system commands that are run from the VS Code–integrated terminal that's exposed in the browser.
* Amazon Cognito to manage identities and authenticate users.
* Amazon CloudWatch to receive log data from the EC2 instances in the private subnets using Amazon CloudWatch Logs agents.
* AWS Lambda to process logs for Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.
* Kinesis Data Firehose to deliver log data from CloudWatch Logs to Amazon S3 and Amazon OpenSearch Service.
* Amazon Route 53 to provide a canonical name (CNAME) record, an alias for the Application Load Balancer.
* Two S3 buckets, one for long-term storage of log files and the other for application-configuration files.
